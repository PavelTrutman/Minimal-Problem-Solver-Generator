\chapter{Polynomial system solving}
Firstly we review the state of the art algorithms for computing Gr\"obner basis. Better understanding of these algoritmhs helps us to more efficiently integrate them into polynomial solving algorithms based on Gr\"obner basis computation.

\section{Buchberger's Algorithm}
Buchberger's Algorithm was the first algorithm for computing Gr\"obener basis and it was invented by Bruno Buchberger.

The first and easy, but very inefficient, implementation of this algorithm says that we can extend a set $F$ of polynomials to a Gr\"obner basis only by adding all nonzero remainders $\overline{S(f_i, f_j)}^F$ of all pairs from $F$ into $F$.  The pseudocode of this algorithm can be found as Theorem 2 in Section 2, \S 7 in \cite{Cox-Little-Shea97}. Gr\"obner basis computed by this algorithm are often bigger than necessary.

\section{$F_4$ Algorithm}
The $F_4$ Algorithm \cite{F4} by Jean-Charles Faug\`ere is an improved version of the Buchberger's Algorithm. The $F_4$ replaces the classical polynomial reduction found in the Buchberger's Algorithm by the simultaneous reduction of several polynomials. This reduction mechanism is achieved by a symbolic precomputation and by use of sparse linear algebra methods. $F_4$  speeds up the reduction step by exchanging multiple polynomial divisions for row-reduction of single matrix.
