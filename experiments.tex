\chapter{Experiments}
To show the usefulness of our improvements of the automatic generator, we have compared several solvers of some minimal problems using different methods in the automatic generator. We have used the benchmark of the automatic generator to generate the solvers and to compare the results because this tool is designed to it perfectly.

We have divided the experiments into three parts. In each part, we are comparing easily comparable methods on which the speed up of the new implemented method can be straightforwardly seen. In the first section, we are comparing one elimination solvers against multiple elimination solvers. In the second part, we are comparing solvers without the matrix partitioning used, with matrix partitioning used only to the last elimation and solvers with matrix partitioning used to all eliminations in the solver. In the last section, we are comparing solvers with different strategies of polynomial generation used. One solver is generated by the systematical generator and the second one is using the $F_4$ strategy.

To generate the solvers, we have used the default settings of the automatic generator obtained by calling of the function \textit{gbs\_InitConfig} if not specified differently. We have tested the generated solvers on randomly generated data, but the data remained the same within each experiment. Each solver was tried on $1\,000$ instances of parameters. All test were performed on Intel Xeon E5-2630 2.30 GHz based computer. The MATLAB R2014a 64-bit was used to the tests.
