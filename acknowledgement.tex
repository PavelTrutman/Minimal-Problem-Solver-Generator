I would like to thank my advisor Tom\'a\v s Pajdla for introducing me into Gr\"obner basis methods for solving polynomial systems and for his guidance and advices which enabled me to finish this thesis. I would also like to thank Zuzana K\'ukelov\'a for presenting me the automatic generator and for her comments to my improvements. Special thanks go to my family for all their support.
