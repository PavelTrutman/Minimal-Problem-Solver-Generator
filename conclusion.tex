\chapter{Conclusion}
In this work, we have focused on how to solve systems of polynomial equations fast and how to automatically generate efficient solvers for these systems.

In the first part, we reviewed the state of the art algorithms for computing Gr\"obner bases of polynomial systems. We described the Buchberger Algorithm~\cite{Buchberger65}, then we explained the $F_4$ Algorithm \cite{F4} by J. Ch. Faug\`ere in details and in the end, we pointed out the main features of the $F_5$ Algorithm \cite{F5}.

In the second part, the automatic generator \cite{AutoGen} of minimal problem solvers was reviewed. This tool enables us to easily generate solvers for systems of polynomial equations which arise when solving minimal problems in computer vision. We described the process of generation of solvers in detail. Then, we suggested several improvements of the automatic generator and we have implemented them. For example, we presented an improvement which allows us to generate multiple elimination solvers, which are usually better for systems of polynomial equations in many unknowns. We also showed that the solvers can be sped up when Gauss-Jordan elimination for sparse matrices is used. Next, we took over a strategy from the $F_4$ Algorithm \cite{F4} and we have implemented it into the automatic generator. For better understanding, we have implemented the~$F_4$ Algorithm \cite{F4} in Maple first. The description of this implementation is provided in this section, too. In the end, we presented the~benchmark of the automatic generator. This tool helps us to decide which generated solver is better for our application.

In the end, we took the 9-point relative pose different radial distortion problem~\cite{9pt} and compared solvers generated with different methods for this problem on~set of randomly generated data. We showed that solvers generated with the new implemented methods may be faster than solvers generated by the old implementation of the automatic generator. We noticed the most visible speed up when the $F_4$ strategy was used. In this case, the solver using the $F_4$ strategy is four times faster than the solver generated by the systematical generator for the 9-point relative pose problem \cite{9pt}.
