\chapter{Automatic generator}
Automatic generators of Gr\"obner basis solvers are used to easily solve problems leading to systems of polynomial equations. The input of the automatic generator is a system of polynomial equations with a finite number of solutions and the output is a MATLAB or a Maple code that computes solutions of the given system for arbitary coefficients. One of the goals of this thesis is to improve previous implementation \cite{AutoGen} to construct more efficient and numerically stable solvers.
